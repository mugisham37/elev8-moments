        I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re here! About three years ago, I swapped my 7+ years in the medical field as a Regional Operations Director for something a bit more <em>glittery</em>. After feeling burnt out, I decided to dive into my true passion: entertaining, decor, and making everything beautiful!

        I&#39;m blessed with an amazing husband who&#39;s my biggest supporter and two beautiful daughters who make up our fabulous little girl tribe. We&#39;re all about spreading joy—whether that&#39;s through our love of Jesus, exploring new places, making unforgettable memories with friends and family, hanging out with our adorable dogs, or savoring a glass of wine with a GH charcuterie board, of course!
