        I'm so glad you're here! About three years ago, I swapped my 7+ years in the medical field as a Regional Operations Director for something a bit more <em>glittery</em>. After feeling burnt out, I decided to dive into my true passion: entertaining, decor, and making everything beautiful!

        I'm blessed with an amazing husband who's my biggest supporter and two beautiful daughters who make up our fabulous little girl tribe. We're all about spreading joy—whether that's through our love of Jesus, exploring new places, making unforgettable memories with friends and family, hanging out with our adorable dogs, or savoring a glass of wine with a GH charcuterie board, of course!
